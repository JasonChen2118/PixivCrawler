### EARLY INCOMPLETE!!

# A versatile Pixiv crawler

## Notification
The project is under early development. 
Functions are frequently added and deleted and the project is lack of stability. 
The file structure will be further organised.


## What can this program do?
Raw data crawler is already functional and feasible.
The functions are integrated in crawler.py.
It can fetch:
1. illusts text (basic info)
2. illust pages text (picture's url)
3. img original content (picture)
4. user profile text (user info)

Other files contains some unpacked features:
1. Get images in order (SimpleCrawler.py)
2. Get artworks text in bulk (infoStore.py)
3. Count each tag's occurrence of one artist (userIllustsTagsAnalysis.py)
4. Analyse illustrator similarity (userTagsSimilarity.py)
